//! Finder opens on macOS: `application:openURLs:`.
//!
//! On Windows a double-clicked file arrives as `argv[1]`, which is what `main` reads. macOS does
//! not work that way. Finder, `open(1)` and a drop on the Dock icon all go through Launch
//! Services, which delivers the file as an **Apple event** to the app — a fresh launch gets no
//! arguments at all, and an app that is *already running* gets no new process, so the instance
//! socket never sees it either. Without this hook Fire opens blank from Finder and ignores every
//! subsequent open. It is the macOS half of the single-instance story, not a nicety.
//!
//! ## Why the delegate method is added at runtime
//!
//! AppKit turns that Apple event into `application:openURLs:` on the `NSApplicationDelegate` —
//! but winit owns the delegate, and it implements neither that method nor a way to extend it.
//! The three ways out are: replace the delegate (winit's `ApplicationDelegate::get` panics if the
//! app's delegate is not its own class, so this crashes on the next event), register a
//! `NSAppleEventManager` handler ourselves (`NSApplication` installs its own during
//! `finishLaunching`, i.e. *after* anything we could do from `main`, so ours would be replaced),
//! or add the one missing method to winit's delegate class. The last is the only one that leaves
//! winit's own dispatch intact, so that is what this does — `class_addMethod` on the class the
//! live delegate belongs to, adding a selector winit does not define.
//!
//! The delegate is then re-set on `NSApplication`. `setDelegate:` caches which delegate methods
//! exist at the moment it is called, and winit calls it before we get here; without the re-set
//! AppKit would go on believing the delegate cannot open files. It is the same object, which
//! winit keeps alive for the life of the event loop (`NSApplication` holds it weakly).
//!
//! ## Ordering
//!
//! A launch-by-open delivers the event *between* `applicationWillFinishLaunching:` and
//! `applicationDidFinishLaunching:` — that is, before winit reports `resumed` and therefore
//! before the first window exists. Those opens are held in [`PENDING`] and handed to the first
//! window by [`start`], so it comes up showing the file instead of coming up blank and loading it
//! a frame later. Everything after `start` goes straight to the event loop as [`AppEvent::Open`],
//! which is the same path a forwarded launch takes.
