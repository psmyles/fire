//! The Metal device and the `CAMetalLayer` sokol_gfx draws through on macOS.
//!
//! sokol_gfx does not own a window: it is handed a device at `sg_setup` (through
//! `sg_environment`) and a render target per frame (through `sg_swapchain`), and the shell owns
//! everything around them. This module is that glue — the twin of [`crate::render::d3d11`], same
//! shape, same contract — and the one place on macOS that names Metal or Core Animation.
//!
//! Three things differ from the D3D11 side, and each is load-bearing:
//!
//! * **The backbuffer is `BGRA8Unorm`, not `RGBA8Unorm`.** A `CAMetalLayer` only accepts a short
//!   list of formats and RGBA8 is not on it. This is a channel *order* difference in storage
//!   only: the shader still writes float4 RGBA and Metal swizzles on the way out, so D20 holds
//!   unchanged — a plain UNORM target that the image shader sRGB-encodes itself.
//! * **sokol presents the drawable, not us.** `sg_end_pass` calls `presentDrawable:` on whatever
//!   `sg_swapchain` was pointed at and `sg_commit` commits the buffer, so [`Swapchain::present`]
//!   only releases our hold on the drawable. Presenting again here would be a double present.
//! * **The frame blocks at acquire, not at present.** `nextDrawable` waits until the display has
//!   taken an earlier frame; D3D11 waits inside `Present(1, 0)` instead. Both are "the handoff
//!   blocked on the display", which is what playback is paced on, so [`Swapchain::present`]
//!   reports the wait this module measured in [`Swapchain::acquire`].
//!
//! The device is created on the bring-up thread (see [`crate::render::gpu::Gpu::start`]) and used
//! from the main thread after the join. The *layer* is not: Core Animation and `NSView` are
//! main-thread-only, so [`Swapchain::new`] must be called there, as its caller (`GpuSurface::new`)
//! is.
